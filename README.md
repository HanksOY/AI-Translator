AI Translator System Architecture (future architecture) 
A real-time AI-powered translation system with virtual avatar integration, built using the LiveKit framework and modern AI services.
System Overview
This system provides an end-to-end AI translation experience combining speech recognition, language translation, text-to-speech, and a virtual avatar interface. The architecture leverages Azure services, Google Cloud AI, and Pinecone for vector storage.
Architecture Components
Core Services
LiveKit Framework

Central orchestration layer managing real-time communication
Handles audio/video streaming and session management
Coordinates between all AI services and user interactions

Assembly AI STT (Speech-to-Text)

Real-time speech recognition
Converts user audio input to text
Supports multiple languages with high accuracy

Gemini 1.5 Flash LLM

Language translation engine
Processes and translates text between languages
Fast response times optimized for real-time conversations

Cartesia TTS (Text-to-Speech)

Converts translated text back to natural-sounding speech
High-quality voice synthesis
Supports multiple voices and languages

Tavus Virtual Avatar

Interactive visual representation
Lip-sync with translated audio output
Provides engaging user experience

Pinecone Vector Database

Stores conversation context and translation history
Enables semantic search and retrieval
Supports RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for improved translation accuracy

Data Flow

User Input: User speaks into the system
Speech Recognition: Assembly AI converts speech to text
Context Retrieval: Pinecone database provides relevant context
Translation: Gemini 1.5 Flash translates text with context awareness
Speech Synthesis: Cartesia generates natural audio output
Avatar Animation: Tavus displays synchronized virtual avatar
User Output: Translated speech and avatar delivered to user

Features
